### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David and I am an undergraduate Computer Engineering student at the
University of Michigan College of Engineering in Ann Arbor, MI. My skills
include C/C++ and Python programming as well as Linux and shell scripting. My
interests include embedded systems and using software to interact with the
physical world. In my free time, I design Arduino and Raspberry Pi based
embedded systems. I enjoy solving problems and look forward to taking on new
challenges.
